Autonomy in foreign/second language learning \n\nThe concept of autonomy in second/foreign language learning and teaching has been \nthe focus of attention for many researchers and practitioners for more than three \ndecades. According to Benson (2001), the notion of autonomy was introduced and \npopularized in 1981 by Henri Holec in his seminal report for the Council of Europe \nentitled Autonomy in Foreign Language Learning in which the researcher defined \nautonomy in the context of language learning as “the ability to take charge of one’s own \nlearning” (Holec, 1981, p. 3). Holec’s idea of autonomy encompasses some components \nand capacities on the part of language learners (e.g. self-directed l\n[page 3] The EUROCALL Review, Volume 25, No. 2, September 2017 \n\n2.2. Autonomy and new technologies \n\nAs stated in the previous section, the concept of autonomy has been one of the most \nresearched areas in the field of second/foreign language learning and teaching over the \nlast few decades. It should be noted, however, that the field of learner autonomy \nstarted to be influenced by technology in the mid-1990s as a result of the growing \ninfluence of the internet on almost every sphere of our life (including second/foreign \nlanguage education) and the opportunities for online collaboration and communication \n(Reinders & White, 2016). As stated by Benson and Chik (2010), the latest generations \nof new technologies, particularly those encompassing the internet, user-generated Web \ncontent and mobility, seem to be having a bearing on the way autonomous language \nlearning develops. Perhaps, one of the most important benefits of implementing new \ntechnologies into language learning is the fact that\n[page 4] The EUROCALL Review, Volume 25, No. 2, September 2017 \n\n3. Method \n\n3.1. Research question \n\nOne of the questions related to future research and practice in technology-mediated \nlearner autonomy addressed by Reinders and White in their recent critical overview of \nthe relationship between technology and autonomy in the journal Language Learning & \nTechnology (LLT) concerned language learners engagement with technology-mediated \nenvironments in order to develop learning experiences that reach their aims and meet \ntheir needs as language learners (Reinders & White, 2016). Taking this important \nmatter into consideration, and in view of the fact that mobile technology, including \nmobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, are ubiquitous and \nsubstantial constituents of almost every language learner’s everyday life, the \nabovementioned question was modified and posed in this study in the following way: \n\nDo students engage with their mobile devices to develop learning experie\n[page 5] The EUROCALL Review, Volume 25, No. 2, September 2017 \n\n Do you organize regular formal or informal mobile English language learning \n\nsessions? \n What do you learn most frequently by means of your mobile device(s)? Why \n\nthis? \n Do you feel that thanks to the use of your mobile device(s) you devote more \n\ntime for learning the English language? \n As far as learning English through your mobile device(s) is concerned, do you \n\nconsider yourself as an experienced user of such device(s)? \n\nThe gathered data were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis. The analysis \nstarted with partial transcription of the important parts of the data (Dörnyei, 2007) on a \ncomputer word processor program Microsoft Word 2016. Then the transcribed parts of \nthe data were read several times in order to look for common themes and frequently \noccurring information. The recurring ideas were coded and recoded, revised and \nupdated. The researcher used the highlighting function of the word processo\n[page 6] The EUROCALL Review, Volume 25, No. 2, September 2017 \n\nS8 \nfemale \nsmartphone \n2 years \nfairly experienced \n\nS9 \nmale \nsmartphone \n4 years \nnot very experienced \n\nS10 \nfemale \nsmartphone \n5 years \nfairly experienced \n\nS11 \nfemale \ntablet and cell phone \n2 years \nfairly experienced \n\nS12 \nfemale \nsmartphone \n2 years \nnot very experienced \n\n3rd year \n\nB.A. \n\nS13 \nfemale \nsmartphone \n3 years \nnot very experienced \n\nS14 \nmale \nsmartphone and tablet \n3 years \nexperienced \n\nS15 \nfemale \nsmartphone and tablet \n5 years \nfairly experienced \n\nS16 \nfemale \nsmartphone \n3 years \nnot very experienced \n\nS17 \nfemale \nsmartphone and tablet \n6 years \nfairly experienced \n\n2nd \nyear \nM.A. \n\nS18 \nfemale \nsmartphone \n5 years \nnot very experienced \n\nS19 \nfemale \nsmartphone and tablet \n5 years \nnot very experienced \n\nS20 \nfemale \nsmartphone and tablet \n5 years \nfairly experienced \n\n4.2.

Finally, some students used their MobDs in order to read language \nmaterials downloaded from the internet (e.g. PDF files). The following responses \nillustrate some of these issues: \n\nS5: I use apps for “index cards”, dictionaries and a variety of apps for \ndeveloping English vocabulary. \n\nS10: I have some online friends and I talk with them in English (Do you do this \nby means of instant messaging applications?) Yes, I use WhatsApp Messenger. \n\nS15: I often read scanned book pages and pdf materials (…) I access English \nvocabulary by means of online dictionaries. \n\nS20: Fiszkoteka. I frequently use this app (...) I also listen to podcasts and I \nhave the app called Six minutes English in order to practice listening (...) Also \nbecause vocabulary is used in a variety of contexts. \n\n4.4. Mobile encounters \n\nThirteen (65%) interviewees\n[page 8] The EUROCALL Review, Volume 25, No. 2, September 2017 \n\nreferred their students to electronic or online resources; however, they did not ask \nstudents to use them in classes, they did not recommend any mobile apps or design \nlanguage tasks which required  using such devices in order to solve them. \n\n4.5. Language practiced \n\nWhen asked to indicate the most frequently practiced language skills and subsystems by \nmeans of mobile devices, all the interviewees indicated the target language vocabulary. \nIn addition to this, some referred to pronunciation and only a few students mentioned \ngrammar and practicing reading, listening and speaking skills. As far as practicing \nEnglish vocabulary is concerned, the subjects chose to practice it through their \nsmartphones and/or tables because they regarded this language subsystem as the most \nimportant to learn, they praised their MobDs for providing them with quick and easy \naccess to needed words and see the way they were used in given sentences\n[page 9] The EUROCALL Review, Volume 25, No. 2, September 2017 \n\ninformation and more on language production, on the use of English ... there is \nless time used but it’s more effective. (S14) \n\nIt is also interesting to note that the use of mobile devices might be valuable for \nkinesthetic or tactical language learners: \n\nI think I spend more time … for me it’s much nicer and more interesting than \nsitting and reading books … it’s better for me since I’m kinesthetic so it’s hard \nfor me to sit and read a traditional book ... it’s because I don’t remember then \nmuch but when I use my smartphone which is mobile I can ... I can do it while \ndoing other activities and this makes things easier for me. (S5) \n\nFinally, it should be noted that 5 (25%) interviewees were not able to say whether or \nnot the use of mobile devices made them study the target language more effectively or \nefficiently and they expressed their opinion by simply claiming that “It’s difficult to say”. \n\n5.

Perhaps a different set of questions, their wording or a series of such \ninterviews carried out over a particular period of time (say one academic year) may \nhave yielded more detailed and insightful results. Despite these limitations, this study \nprovided some insights into why and how advanced English language learners engage \nwith their mobile devices to develop learning experiences. It should be stressed, \nhowever, that teacher involvement in creating conditions conducive to the use of mobile \ndevices for language study may result in greater learner engagement with mobile \ntechnology (i.e. mobile devices) and, at the same time, may lead to greater students’ \nindependence in learning the target language. \n\nReferences \n\nBenson, P.
